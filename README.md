# Data-sexual-abuse-analysis

In this project we have a survey from Beginner and intermediate parents on the sexual abuse of their children.

The question that were asked are:
1. Children are safe among family members such as grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins
2. Children are mainly abused by strangers in our society
3. Male children dont need sexual abuse prevention knowledge	
4. Teaching sexual abuse prevention in school is not necessary. It will make children curious about sex
5. Do you know what child grooming is?	Do you know what signs to look for to identify if your child has been abused?
6. Do you think children need post abuse counseling for recovering?
7. Do you think you should take legal action against the abuser of your child?

I used ID3 algorithm from decision trees to check which questions are much more relevant to survey.
They can be found inside the ipynb file along with thier analysis.
